# NodeWhisper
A JS class written for Node that standardizes creation of sockets and children as well as communication between them.
This class aims to slim down the time required by the developer spent on setting up the necessary processes to establish connections across a network (or networks).

TO TRY OUT THE TEST FILES
1) First open test_server.js in a Node window.
2) Then open test_client.js in a Node window.
Result: The test client will automatically send a message via socket to the test server, which will parse the message and reply. The client will then parse the received message.
